# Convolutions with Kernel
This project is a simple implementation of convolutional neural networks using a kernel. The project is implemented in Python using the NumPy library.

The project Load the ⅽaⅿeraman dataset into PyTorch using the skiⅿage library and blur and display the image using convolution and the appropriate kernel.

### Packages
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PyTorch
- Skiⅿage
